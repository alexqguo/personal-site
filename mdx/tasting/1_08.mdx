This week the Gallo family returns to us, in the form of two sweet wines - one being <span style={{color:"#27ae60"}}>green apple</span> flavored and the other being a <span style={{color:"#9b59b6"}}>grapefruit rose</span>. These are some of the cheapest wines we have ever had for the tasting, each coming in under $4. The E&J Gallo winery is the same one that produces some of our favorites, including Thunderbird and Night Train (though they probably wouldnâ€™t admit that).

Below are some fun facts. Since this is not our first tasting of a Gallo wine, Iâ€™ll try to include some more obscure facts that I did not include last time.

* E&J Gallo Winery was founded by brothers Ernest and Julio, however they had a third brother, Joseph. Joseph was a rancher and coincidentally also a cheese maker, who ran Joseph Gallo Farms. He was however sued by his own brothers and forced to stop using the Gallo name on his cheese
* Their father, Giuseppe Gallo was an immigrant from Italy. He died in a murder suicide, shooting his wife and then himself
* E&J Gallo Winery is the largest family owned wine company in the world, and also the largest exporter of California wines
* Joseph Farms is still in operation today and is actually quite successful. Their cheese is free of artificial hormones, and they have won many cheese awards. In 2009, their provolone cheese was named the best in the world at the World Cheese Awards
