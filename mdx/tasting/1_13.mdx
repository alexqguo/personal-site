We have a very special wine tasting this week. Sadly, Friday is Alberto’s last day at Audible so let’s say goodbye to him the only way we/I know how – drinking! Our featured wines are a <span style={{color:"#c0392b"}}>**Tempranillo**</span> (Viña Alberdi) and <span style={{color:"#c0392b"}}>**Garnacha**</span> (Espelt), which were requested by Alberto. In lieu of fun facts about the wine, I will instead list some fun facts about Alberto.

As always, a selection of artisanal nuts and cheeses will be provided.

* The wine tastings started at Alberto’s old desk, which was named *The Vineyard* without his approval. Sean and I needed a place to test out Wild Irish Rose and he didn’t want such a foul beverage touching his desk
* Alberto’s first commit at Audible was “██████████████████” on March 25, 2014. In the testing done section of the code review Alberto wrote “Not Yet.”
* As of today (Wednesday, May 16), Alberto has made **2,422** code changes, good for **960,442** lines added and **553,265** lines removed (!)
* Alberto will be moving to the █████████████████ team in Amazon Manhattan, where he will be reuniting with a friendly face
* Alberto once commissioned me to bake a cake for him, however once I brought it in he never paid me :( His loan was sold and now Jeff owes me $80
* Looking through Alberto’s entire git history at Audible, you will uncover a myriad of obscure packages. My personal favorite has to be **███████McDonalds████████**, with one of the commits being “Adding McDonalds Dependencies” (ask Alberto about what this is)
* Alberto created the ███████ documentation site (█████████████), but accidentally named the main package █████████████ (yes, with the capital K). By the time he realized the typo it was too late
* Through his 4+ years at Audible, Alberto has been on many different teams and involved in many different projects. I’m almost certainly missing some, but the chronology looks something like this: █████ -> █████ -> █████ -> █████ -> ████ haha just kidding █████ -> █████
* 💰Each bottle was roughly $20 each 💰
