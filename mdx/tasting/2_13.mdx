Guess what's back? Not the McRib. You guessed it, it's everyone's favorite energy beer, **Four Loko**! Due to "popular demand" we will be enjoying a victory lap for this fan favorite premium malt beverage (with natural and artificial flavors). To recap what happened last time around, we sampled the <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Peach**</span>, **Black**, <span style={{color:"#f39c12"}}>**Blaze**</span> and <span style={{color:"#e74c3c"}}>**Watermelon**</span>flavors. We will be diversifying our palette this time with some of Four Loko's rarer offerings (all between 12-14% ABV).

Our lineup this time will be:
<span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Gold**</span> - “Tastes like gold. Nothing more to say”
<span style={{color:"#3498db"}}>**Frost**</span> - “The best way tot CHILL out after a long day of work”
<span style={{color:"#2ecc71"}}>**Sour Apple**</span> - “Sweet, tart and tangy all in one! With a perfect subtle touch of sour, this drink won't have your face puckering after one sip”

In the Malt Liquor Tasting Series co-hosting requirements doc, it very clearly articulates, among other things, a minimum requirement of 300-500 words for the writeup. However, Raheed was incapable of producing said writeup, providing only a meager 150 words. He then tried to cover his mistake with a for loop. Because of this I would like to let everyone know that despite co-hosting a tasting event typically being a sponsorship status bump, Raheed's upgrade will continue to be under review for the time being. Even Raheed's gold tier sponsorship eventually does get approved, this series of events puts his gold sponsorship gift at question as well. Until then, please enjoy the event as you normally would. Reach out to alexguo@ if you would like to learn more about co-hosting or sponsorship opportunities.

**[[[EDIT 2]]]** After long deliberation, I have decided to promote Raheed to a <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Gold**</span>-tier sponsor of the tasting series. He will be subject to a three month review at which point, depending on performance, he may be demoted back to <span style={{color:"#bdc3c7"}}>**Silver**</span>.
