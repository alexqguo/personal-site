It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to Tommy this week. To send him off, we will be having **St. Ides**, a malt liquor produced by Pabst. St. Ides had its debut in 1987, and has an ABV of 8.2%. Here are a few fun facts about St. Ides:

* St. Ides has flavored varieties as well, which we may try in this series at a later date if I can find it
* To build its brand identity, St. Ides relied on hip hop, pop culture and many celebrity endorsements, primarily by rappers
* Very much in line with a theme we've seen, rapper Chuck D took a stance against malt liquor advertising and actually sued McKenzie River Brewing Company (the owners of St. Ides at the time) for using his voice without permission. This may have backfired, however, as the lawsuit generated publicity for the brand
* According to wikipedia, rappers that have mentioned St. Ides in their music include Andre Nickatina, Ice Cube, 2Pac, Kool G Rap, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Nate Dogg, Afroman, MC Eiht, Spice 1, Scarface, E-40, Wu-Tang Clan, Project Pat, King Tee, DJ Pooh, The Notorious B.I.G., Eric B & Rakim, EPMD, Method Man & Redman, Eazy-E, Cypress Hill, RBL Posse, Luniz, Jarren Benton, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Phantom Balance, Tha Dogg Pound, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Beanie Sigel and the Geto Boys as well as KMD

And to commemorate his last week, here are some fun facts about Tommy:

* Tommy's first day at Audible was June 12, 2017. Since then, he has amassed just 11 phone tool icons. Quite pathetic if you ask me
* Tommy will be joining the ████████████ team in ███████████████
* Tommy has been to California many times, but never lived there
* In his time here, Tommy has made 262 code changes, good for 16,532 lines added and 7,457 lines removed across 51 packages (as of Tuesday). He has also closed 61 tickets
* Other than SDE bootcamp, Tommy's first code change was "██████████████████████████" The CR is ██████████████████████████
* Tommy has been on two teams at Audible, Discovery and Gemini. During that time he has contributed to major projects like the Arya migration, search logging and the similar author API
* Of all the packages to which he has contributed, █████████████████████ is where Tommy has dedicated the majority of his efforts, with 36 commits (13.7% of his total) going to that package
* Tommy actually shares an apartment with another Audible employee (Pedro) in Chelsea
* Tommy played in his first ever organized soccer game this past fall on the Invalid Headers team! The fun fact he submitted was "I suck at soccer."
