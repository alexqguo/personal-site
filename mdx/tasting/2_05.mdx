For Dave’s last day, we will be having a classic, **Colt 45** (5.6% ABV)! One of the most notorious malt liquors around, it was introduced by National Brewing Company back in 1963. When it debuted, the only other major national brand of malt liquor was Country Club. National Brewing Company and all of its brands are currently owned by Pabst. Contrary to popular belief, Colt 45 was named after Baltimore Colts running back #45 Jerry Hill, and not the .45 caliber ammunition round. Here are some fun facts about Colt 45:

* Cans of Colt 45 are available in 12, 16 and 24 ounce varieties, while bottles are available in 7, 12, 16, 18, 22, 32 and 40 ounce packages
* Billy Dee Williams has appeared in numerous advertisements for Colt 45 since the 1980s. “It works every time,” Colt 45’s slogan, was said by Williams in every commercial he appeared in
* For a brief time in the 1990s, a mint flavored Colt 45 was available, called Cool Colt. Most consumers didn’t know what to make of the drink, and it disappeared shortly after
* A double malt version of Colt 45 is available for purchase in certain areas of the country. It is distinguishable by two horseshoes on the label instead of one
* In 2011, Pabst introduced Blast by Colt 45 with Snoop Dogg as the “brand ambassador” of the drink. As a 12% ABV fruit flavored malt beverage, similar to many others we’ve had so far, it was criticized for targeting underage drinkers. It does not contain caffeine, taurine or guarana
