We are featuring two very special wines this week: Manischewitz’s <span style={{color:"#8e44ad"}}>**Blackberry**</span> and <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Cream White Concord**</span> wines. Manischewitz is an American based producer of kosher goods and are most known for their matzo and wine.
In case you aren’t too familiar with the term, kosher is essentially a set of Jewish dietary laws, mainly prohibiting pork, shellfish, most insects and some meats and milks. However kosher also has stipulations regarding wine, prohibiting anything which falls under these categories:

1. Fruit from a tree which was planted within three years (this includes the grapes that go into wine)
1. ​Wine made for [idolatrous​](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idolatrous) purposes
1. ​Wine not produced at least in part by Jews

These two wines both have an 11% ABV and, from what I can tell, are VERY sweet. Additional fun facts:

* ​Manischewitz was founded all the way back in 1888 by Rabbi Dov Behr Manischewitz in Cincinnati, Ohio
* ​Manischewitz completely transformed the process by which matzo is produced. They were the first company to mass produce it, turning it from a local product eventually into an international one. They even have a matzo producing facility here in Newark at 80 Avenue K. This topic is pretty interesting and I encourage you research more about it if you’re interested
* ​The Manischewitz winery is located in Canandaigua, New York
* Manischewitz wine has a slogan, “Man-O-Manischewitz, what a wine!” which was actually seen in the show Mad Men, as the company was featured in an episode
* 💰$7 per bottle 💰
