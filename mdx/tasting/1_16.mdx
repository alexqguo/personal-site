I am very excited for this weekâ€™s wine tasting. One of the last remaining staples of cheap wine which we have not yet tried, Charles Shaw Blend (aka two buck chuck) wine takes bargain wine to the extreme. Debuting in 2002 and sold almost exclusively at Trader Joeâ€™s, Charles Shaw wine generally sells for between $1.99 and $2.99 depending on what state it is purchased in (in NYC it is $2.99). That also means that these are the **CHEAPEST** full size bottles of wine we have ever had in this series! All the more impressive considering that they were purchased in NYC and not Newark.

We will be having three bottles, a <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Pinot Grigio**</span> (12.5% ABV), <span style={{color:"#e74c3c"}}>**White Zinfandel**</span> (10.5% ABV) and <span style={{color:"#c0392b"}}>**Cabernet Sauvignon**</span> (12.5% ABV). Charles Shaw wine may reappear at a wine tasting in the near future, so keep your eyes peeled! Anyway, here are some more fun facts about two buck chuck:

* Believe it or not, bottles for two buck chuck are not twist-offs, rather they use an extremely cheap variety of natural cork. They could potentially cut costs further by using plastic corks, but they believed that it could potentially affect the taste of the wine and potentially cheapen customersâ€™ perception of the wine (â€¦lol)
* Charles Shaw produces gigantic quantities of wine which helps keep production costs low
* Another strategy to reduce costs is to ferment the wine in oak chips as opposed to oak barrels
* You may notice that the bottles are a slightly different shape than normal wine bottles (a bit shorter and lighter). This is yet again to reduce production costs
* This wine has actually won multiple awards (for what Iâ€™m not sure). For instance, in 2013 the cabernet took a gold medal at the 2013 Orange County Fair Wine Competition
* ðŸ’°$2.99 per bottle! ðŸ’°
