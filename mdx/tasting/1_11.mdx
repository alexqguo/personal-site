For this installment we will be trying something that has captured my curiosity for quite some time. A <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Pinot Grigio**</span> and <span style={{color:"#c0392b"}}>**Cabernet**</span> from **Chateau Diana**, a winery in California. Now before you get excited that we might be actually trying real wine this week, know that these aren't real wines! They are "wine products" which is sort of like a fortified wine but in the opposite direction. According to the New York State Liquor Authority, a wine product is "a beverage containing wine with added juice flavoring, water, citric acid, sugar, and carbon dioxide" which admittedly doesn't sound promising. Another thing to note is that I did not get these wines in Newark. Rather, I trekked all the way to the CVS five minutes from my Brooklyn apartment. That's right, I bought these wines at CVS, where they are a staple across NYC.

A few more interesting things about wine products and Chateau Diana:

* Another stipulation about "wine product" is that it must not exceed **6% ABV**. So these will not be the strongest wines you have ever had in your life
* Since they are not real wines, the bottles both have the typical nutrition facts that we see on our food products
* The first ingredient listed in both wines is "California table wine" üòê
* The reason you see this kind of product at drug stores all the time in NYC is that New York has a law stating that wine can only be sold at liquor stores. However this, not being real wine, is able to be sold at CVS/Duane Reade/etc.
* Chateau Diana was founded in 1981 by Tom and Diane Manning, who are both from NYC
* Funnily enough, Chateau Diana is a real California winery which produces real wines, up to the $40-50 range. You can check out their website [here](https://www.chateaud.com/) though it will not list any "wine products"
* DO NOT ever bring this wine to a party or any sort of social event. You will be laughed out of town
