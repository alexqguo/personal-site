Okay, NOW we're back! As many office situations are starting to return slowly in hybrid model form, so will this series. Spring '21 has seen some of the biggest seismic shifts in the modern world, including the return of this series, and possibly eventually an eclipse of its pre-pandemic glory.

For this very special edition of our hard seltzer series, we will be enjoying a new take on an old classic in the form of **AriZona SunRise Hard Seltzer**. Picked namely for its similarities to our newly fallen comrade Andrew, SunRise is an irreverent yet vaguely familiar taste, a constant attempt to be healthy only to be undermined by its alcoholic content (4.6% ABV), and reacts with volatility if shaken too vigorously. Though also it's sold at the drink stand at Pier 17.

That's right, this event will NOT be held in the office! This will be a dual virtual and in person event. Given the state of the pandemic, as well as distance from the office, if you don't want to show up in person and instead attend from the comfort of your own home, we will be having a simulcast on **████████████**. Prepare your favorite beverage before joining!

For those who will be attending in person, directions are listed below. As we will be supporting a NYC based business and buying our beverages from the drink stand at Pier 17 (at a ridiculous markup I might add), in the spirit of the tasting series the organizers of the event will cover the price of your first drink!

As is tradition, in lieu of fun facts about SunRise Hard Seltzer, here are some fun facts about Andrew to celebrate him moving on to the next phase of his career:

* Andrew has NO MIDDLE NAME. It's just an F
* He had eight pets growing up
* He has traveled to 36 (!!) countries, and collects magnets of places he's been to. The more obscure the better!
* He attended the last ever game at Shea Stadium. The Mets lost. <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN200809280.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Box score</a>
* He accidentally ran over his sister's leg with a bike and broke it when he was 7 years old

Before concluding this writeup, I would be doing a disservice if I did not mention the others who have moved on from the ███ team since the last installment of this series. Let's take a moment to recognize █████, █████, ██████, ██████, ██, and ████ (and perhaps others that I forgot), and their great contributions to the team. Each of them all deserved their own goodbye events, and I wish the circumstances could have allowed for that. Let's pour one out for our fallen teammates.

We will be on the North side of the pier, at one of the long stone picnic tables, just outside of the “Malibu Farm” restaurant. North is the side that you can see the Brooklyn Bridge from. Please bring significant others, dogs, bikes, or anything else your heart desires. After party at [[Jeremy’s Ale House>>url:https://www.yelp.com/biz/jeremys-ale-house-south-street-seaport-new-york]], 228 Front St. A short block and a half away.
