Riunite is an Italian wine founded in 1950. After about a decade of being in business, they started to find a lot of success exporting their wines to America, and exported a then record 11.5 million cases of wine to America in 1985. Our first wine is their <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Soft White Wine**</span> which should have a more casual taste that you all should be familiar with. The second is a <span style={{color:"#c0392b"}}>**Raspberry Red Wine**</span> which is going to be on the sweeter side (hopefully not as much as the Manischewitz). Additional fun facts:

* Riunite was at its most popular in the 70s and 80s, largely in part to their many advertisements and catch phrase ‚ÄúRiunite on ice, that‚Äôs nice!‚Äù
* The first wine that Riunite exported to America was a type of sparkling red wine (frizzante in Italian) called Lambrusco
* Lambrusco is not only the name of the type of wine, but also the name of the type of grape used to make it
* Lambrusco grapes are native to central Italy, and archaeological evidence indicates that the Etruscans (really old Italian civilization) were drinking them before the second century BC!
* In 1976, Riunite became the largest source of imported wines in America, 9 years after sending over their Lambrusco for the first time
* When Riunite hit 11.5 million cases imported in America in the 80s, that was more than the next six imported brands combined! It was a pretty big deal back then
* Riunite rebranded in 2006 and 2015, and the white wine we will be having has the pre-2015 branding on it so it is likely quite old
