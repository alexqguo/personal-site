Hello everyone! After a short break, we are BACK and better than ever! We will be sampling **Clubtails**, the "original" cocktail in a can. Both <span style={{color:"#e67e22"}}>**Sex on the Beach**</span> and <span style={{color:"#c0392b"}}>**Long Island Iced Tea**</span> flavors will be available, and they are 10% ABV each. Clubtails launched in 2012 with just two flavors but have since expanded to 12 varieties of cocktails. They are owned by the Geloso Beverage Group, a Rochester based malt beverage distributor also in charge of Johny Bootlegger, Lolita and Pepito (who knows, we may even see those drinks in the future).

The person who we have to thank for Clubtails' existence is likely Vincenzo Geloso. He arrived in Montreal from Italy in 1957 with his family, and soon founded a wine producing company, which happened to be Quebec's first. This eventually became the Geloso Beverage Group. They expanded into beer sales in the early 90s and were in fact the first to introduce imported beers to grocery and convenience store channels in Canada. As the 2000s were approaching, Geloso tackled so-called "malternatives" and debuted Poppers Hard Ice. After foraying into ciders as well, Geloso clearly displays a formidable passion for growth and innovation.

Here are some more fun facts about Clubtails and the Geloso Beverage Group:

* Among Geloso's many other firsts is also the importation of fresh European grapes for wine production
* Geloso also pioneered an infrastructure for production of sparkling wines in closed vats (known as the Charmat method)
* In addition to Sex on the Beach and Long Island Iced Tea, Clubtails also offers other flavors including but not limited to Alabama slammer, Bahama Mama, Watermelon Margarita, Blue Motorcycle, Screwdriver and Lemon Drop
* Clubtails beverages come in three sizes: 24oz cans, 16oz cans and 11.2oz six packs
* Geloso classifies their malt beverages as "progressive adult beverages," whatever that means
* (UPDATE) the term "progressive adult beverage" actually seems to be known around the industry, and can be shortened to PAB
