For this installment we will sample a brand new entry to the market, **Spindrift Spiked**!! Their variety pack has four flavors, <span style={{ color: 'yellow' }}>**Pineapple**</span>, <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Mango**</span><span style={{ color: 'lime' }}>, **Lime**</span> and <span style={{ color: 'brown' }}>**Half & Half**</span>, all at 4% ABV. Being my personal favorite sparkling water, Spindrift has been making its mark by using real fruit juice in their products as opposed to "natural flavors" used by most other competitors. That said, my expectations taste wise are particularly high.

Spindrift Beverage Co. was founded in 2010 by Bill Creelman. Having grown up on a farm in Massachusetts, Bill and his family had always loved fresh ingredients. When he was younger, his family would even forage for plums and catch fish which they would then eat for dinner. Wanting to maintain a healthy lifestyle and impart the same on his children, Bill struggled to find an appropriate beverage to pair with his farm to table meals, as diet sodas were often full of artificial sweeteners and other chemicals. Spindrift was born shortly thereafter, following a long period of experimentation. Bill was inspired to name his drinks Spindrift as it means the spray that comes off of a breaking wave, which was inspiration from when Bill worked on a fishing boat in Nantucket. As mentioned above, Spindrift has made its mark by using real squeezed juice as the flavor in their sparkling waters, different from nearly every other sparking water manufacturer. And you can taste the difference as well. Whether or not you prefer this approach (I do), Spindrift is markedly different from its competitors such as La Croix, Polar, Bubly and Hal's.

And for every reason that Bill created Spindrift, the same apply to the conception of Spindrift Spiked. All hard seltzers that I am aware of list "natural flavors" in their ingredients, but have you ever wondered what this actually means? The <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=501.22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FDA</a> defines "natural flavors" as *the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional.* That's a lot to take in, but it basically means a flavor that's derived from a natural source. Those who create these flavors are specifically trained chemists called flavorists. The issue however, is that this derivation process (for non-organic foods) often involves other unrestricted chemical additives, resulting in a final product which can have an extremely similar chemical composition to that of artificial flavorings. What's more, there is no requirement to list the ingredients in the natural flavors so those with highly specific allergies could be susceptible to a reaction. Because of this, it can be hard to tell how "natural" your natural flavors are. This isn't to say that all natural flavors are more artificial than not, but in my experience sometimes it can be easy to tell. Want to see for yourself? Go try a La Croix, then have any flavor of a can of Bud Light Retro Tie Dye Seltzer (possible future Tasting Series entry) and see which one tastes more natural!

It is for this key reason why Spindrift Spiked now exists. I thank Bill and the rest of the team at Spindrift for creating a hard seltzer with (supposedly) simple ingredients and (hopefully) a much more natural taste. I may come back and edit this entry if that turns out not to be the case.
