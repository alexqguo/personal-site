Hey everyone, this time around we will be sampling **Arnold Palmer Spiked** to celebrate Jake's time with ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà. We wish him the best moving forward.

Arnold Palmer Spiked is a 5% ABV flavored malt beverage, based on the very popular lemonade and iced tea drink of the same name made by Arizona. It came to be through a partnership between Arizona Beverages and MillerCoors and was launched just this past year. To celebrate its launch, Arnold Palmer Spiked was made available at numerous sporting festivals and events throughout the country, including Topgolf. According to Nielsen (an information and measurement company) it was even the number one new brand introduced in 2018 at a point in time.
