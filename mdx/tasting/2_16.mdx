We have a very special tasting today. It is with a heavy heart that we bid farewell to not one, but two key members of the Unity project today- Warren and Alberto. To celebrate their time here and all of their key contributions across Amazon, Quidsi and Audible, we will be sampling <span style={{color:"#c0392b"}}>**Twisted Tea**</span> (5% ABV), a FMB produced by the Twisted Tea Company (a subsidiary of Boston Beer Company). As much as I would like to do another deep dive into the fascinating rise in popularity of the FMB category, alas, my emotions are getting the better of me. Instead let's take a look at some fun facts about Warren and Alberto. We wish you both the best of luck to wherever life takes you next.

**Warren**

* Was the cofounder of "the world's first online tailoring company" A Suit That Fits
* A Suit That Fits was founded in 2006 by Warren and his "school friend" David H. Read a feature about their company <a href="https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/entrepreneur-interviews/secrets-of-success/secret-of-my-success-warren-bennett-a-suit-that-fits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>
* Unfortunately, A Suit That Fits went under this past year
* Warren is a graduate of MIT and Cambridge, where he studied primarily Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering. However, he participated in other activities such as Tennis, Squash and Pottery
* Warren has created 603 ███s, resolved 260 and commented on 1,055 ███s during his time at Amazon
* Warren's last day will be December 6th

**Alberto**

* This is the **fourth** (!!) goodbye event I have hosted for Alberto, which holds the record of most goodbye events I've thrown for a single person. No one else has more than one
* Since Alberto's last goodbye event (May 18, 2018), Alberto has made 202 code changes, good for 118,877 lines added and 21,816 lines removed over 30 packages, with the vast majority coming from ██████████████
* Of these commits (other than the infamous "F"), my favorite has to be "Code code"
  * Other honorable mentions: *I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul*, *G-d over God*, *Adding McDonalds Dependencies*, *Temporal correctiong for player, this solution is stable and works correctly. this is not meant to become canon, due to the eclectict nature to work around the html constrains. As a fast follow a complete refactor of the player button attachment is necessary*
* Alberto's last day will be November 29th
