For our final wine tasting we will be featuring the "greatest hits‚Äù of this series, meaning the gutter wines are back, bigger and better than ever! **Thunderbird**, **Night Train**, **Cisco**, **MD 20/20** and **Wild Irish Rose** will all be present. For those unfamiliar, these are <a href="https://w.amazon.com/index.php?title=User:Alexguo/Tasting&action=edit#Fortified_Wine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">fortified wines</a>, and rather cheap ones at that. Given that this is our last wine tasting, our format will be a bit different from usual. We‚Äôll have everything from memoirs to awards to retrospectives, not to mention the usual jazz and yule log!

Here are my favorite facts about each wine:

**Thunderbird**

* Thunderbird turns your tongue black. This effect is temporary (and safe)

**Night Train**

* Some people claim that Night Train is just Thunderbird with some sort of Kool Aid substance added to it to change the flavor and color. Hmm... üòâ

**Cisco**

* The Federal Trade Commission required Cisco to put additional labelling on their bottles stating "This is not a wine cooler" due to consumers thinking it was a wine cooler and drinking too much. The FTC also forced Cisco to change the shape of their bottle (due to its resemblance to that of a typical wine cooler)

**MD 20/20**

* "20/20" used to refer to bottles being 20 ounces of 20% ABV, though that had to change. "MD" also does **not** stand for "Mad Dog," rather it stands for "Mogen David"

**Wild Irish Rose**

* One of the earliest branded wines around, Richard's Wild Irish Rose has been around for over 50 years!

#### Fortified Wine
Fortified wine is wine that has been "enhanced" by a spirit, often times brandy. Cheaper fortified wines like the ones we will be having became particularly popular during the great depression, since they had a higher alcohol content. They then began being associated with the homeless (hence the term "bum wine") in part due to specific targeting of low income areas through advertising campaigns. In 2006, the Washington State Liquor Control Board even banned various cheap alcohol products from so called "alcohol impact areas." Good for them. All five of our featured wines were part of that ban.

#### Summary
While there are many things that we could be celebrating at an event like this, I most of all would like to celebrate everyone who has attended the wine tastings and made them enjoyable for all, and more importantly put up with all of the god awful liquor I have purchased. Lastly, please be respectful and clean up after yourselves. Thanks!
