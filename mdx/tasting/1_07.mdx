We have a rather curious installment this week. It's **El Leon**, all the way from the Dominican Republic! This one is pretty puzzling. Little information is available about this wine, and honestly I'm pretty sure it's not even made any more. Other than it being a 12% ABV red wine from the DR, I can't tell you much. See below for some fun confusing facts.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you are not a ██/██ on the █████████ team, you can ignore this. Given that this wine tasting happens to coincide with the end of the accessibility bug bash (which is scheduled until 5 for some reason), **participation in the tasting will only be allowed if you put out at least one code review for an accessibility bug as part of the bug bash**. That way we can all get get the best of both worlds. This is non-negotiable, thanks!

* ​​El Leon is a product of the Dominican Republic, produced and bottled by Barcelo & Co (apparently). However, all of my google searches trying to find more information about this producer led me to the website of a hotel corporation. Going directly to the URL on the bottle gets me redirected to the website of Dubar Imperial Rum, which mentions nothing of Barcelo or wine in general
* The company that imports El Leon, Sevillana Imports, is located in Miami. Their website however is completely in Japanese and mentions nothing of wine. Rather, it seems to be a site about improving your life by reducing constipation with enzymes. It’s actually quite bizarre, because the site doesn’t appear to be talking about any specific enzymes, advertising any actual products (just talking about enzymes and having smooth defecations), and has has nothing to do with Sevillana Imports. I did a bit more digging on that, and unfortunately all of the domain registration info points to the company that was likely used to register the domain. I would guess that this is Japan’s version of a WhoIs guard. HOWEVER something interesting that I noticed is that the domain registration expires this Sunday. Quite the coincidence
