If White Claw feels like a "fruit whispering into your mouth as you drink" then Truly feels like compost is farting in your mouth. Actually, that's a bit of hyperbole. It's more like drinking your grandpa's armpit sweat. For this session of our tasting series we will be sampling **Truly**, one of the most inexplicably popular and unfortunate spiked seltzer offerings on the market. There are a number of variety packs but most of their range are all 5% ABV. These variety packs include themes such as margarita style, tea, lemonade, tropical mix, and the abhorrent holiday party pack. The holiday party pack is basically like the Bud Light Seltzer seasonal variety packs, but produced non-ironically. There also exists Truly Extra, a stronger 8% ABV offering, and Truly Vodka Seltzer, a spirit based cocktail more similar in makeup to High Noon.

Truly was one of the earliest spiked seltzers available in the states, debuting in 2016 as Truly Spiked and Sparkling, a name they held until 2019 when they rebranded to Truly Hard Seltzer. They debuted in a glass bottle six pack, but quickly switched to 12 packs of narrow 12oz cans, copying White Claw. If you wanted more justification as to why Truly is the more inept of the two brands, as it turns out they've had to change their recipe twice since debuting. White Claw has never had to change its recipe.

Truly is produced by the Boston Beer company, the same sickos who have brought us Samuel Adams beer and Twisted Tea. When I learned this, every single thing, every aspect of Truly Hard Seltzer as a product made sense to me in an instant. Despite these dismaying revelations, Truly has been there from the beginning of the hard seltzer boom, along with White Claw. They dominated the hard seltzer competition, combining for a near 80% total market share between the two of them as recently as 2020. However as newer, much better seltzers have hit the market at similarly competitive price points, that market share has dwindled. While it's unlikely Truly will ever fade into obscurity, it seems likely they will settle into their rightful place amongst other hard seltzers as the option you go to when you're making an emergency alcohol run when your local bodega is the only place that's open, and you'd usually buy White Claw there but they're out so you have to settle to pay an exorbitant markup for Truly which you know in your heart is not worth that price, but you pay it anyway because you don't want to disappoint your friends who are counting on you to make this alcohol run.

Frankly I don't want to further dignify Truly by writing more about it, so I'll wrap it up here.
