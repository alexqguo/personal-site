An interesting specimen comes to us this week in the form of Anheuser-Busch’s <span style={{color:"#2ecc71"}}>**Lime-a-Rita**</span> and the rest of the **Rita** family! Anheuser-Busch had noticed that many consumers of Bud Light Lime were mixing it with margaritas to create so called “beer ritas,” and in 2012 decided to capitalize on the situation by introducing the Lime-a-Rita. “Lime-a-Rita just adds a new level of convenience by providing a beverage with the perfect balance of flavors,” the company was quoted saying. In the following years, new flavors were introduced, including strawberry and mango. I am happy to say that we will be having as many of these flavors as I can get my hands on (all 8% ABV)!

Here are some more interesting facts about Lime-a-Rita and the Rita family:

* Reviews of the drink (Lime-a-Rita specifically) are mixed to generally positive, noting the drink's palatability. It even drew some comparisons to Mike's Hard (is that good?)
* Ace Metrix awarded Lime-A-Rita the title of 2014 Brand of the Year for the Beer and the Spirits, Malt Beverages and Wine categories. Ace Metrix is a video advertising company
* The Lime-a-Rita brand became the second-best selling new alcoholic product launch in 2012
* Internally, Anheuser-Busch groups its beer and malt beverages into four categories: sub-premium, premium, premium plus and highend
  * Sub-premium consists largely of lagers such as Keystone and Natrual (go figure)
  * Premium is what I would consider the "pretty bad" to "meh, okay I guess" category, including Budweiser, Miller and Coors (light varieties included, not sure about ice)
  * Premium plus is a (very small) step above that and astonishingly includes Bud Light Lime of all things. Michelob Ultra, Bud Light Platinum and our Rita drinks fall into this category
  * Highend is mostly craft beers like Goose Island (remember that Anheuser-Bush owns many different brands, some of which would surprise you, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anheuser-Busch_brands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>
