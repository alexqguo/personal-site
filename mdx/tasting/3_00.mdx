title: "Spiked Seltzers"
---

A year ago, this would never have happened. There were plenty of other worthy candidates to lead the theme of Season Three, but none of them possessed the wide appeal, popularity, trendiness points, and overall mania that spiked seltzers did. Many stores were not even selling them until late last year. And I'm sure I can't be the only one to see that as popularity rose, so did the prices! But money is never an object in this series. Rather, this series is about bringing people together to try something spectacular. And with where the spiked seltzer industry is right now, there's no better choice for the theme of Season Three! So enjoy and taste responsibly!
