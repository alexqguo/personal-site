This week, we feature another Anheuser-Busch classic, **King Cobra**, a malt beverage from the beer monolith. Unlike many of the other malt beverages we've sampled recently, this one comes in at only 6% ABV. Let's see if we can taste any differences in the flavor compared to other classics like St. Ides and Steel Reserve! The beer has no connection to the snake as far as I can tell other than the name, and furthermore the logo bears no resemblance to the actual snake either.

King Cobra is brewed at a warmer fermentation point than many other lagers from Anheuser-Bush, and contains barley malt and corn as some of its ingredients. After the beer launched in the 1980s, the actor, mixed martial artist and American football player Fred Williamson partook in an advertising campaign for the beer, with the slogan "Don't let the smooth taste fool you!"

In 2014, a challenge appeared on the internet called the Killer King Cobra challenge. This involved someone drinking three tall boys of King Cobra in a row. This challenge reemerged as recently as 2017. We will **not** be partaking in this challenge, however feel free to try it safely on your own time. There is a video of one of these challenges on YouTube, however I strongly recommend you do not watch it. If you did, err, want to watch it, um, you could maybe find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks-NbeIo7dY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

As King Cobra is a relatively uncommon beer and no more information exists about it online, I will instead talk about the king cobra snake, also known as the hamadryad. The snake was discovered in 1836 by a Danish naturalist named Theodore Edward Cantor and is located nowadays in parts of India and southeast Asia. It is also the national reptile of India. They can grow up to four meters long, making it the world's longest venomous snake! Despite having "cobra" in its name it doesn't actually belong to the Naja genus, which contains most other cobras. Rather it has its own genus, Ophiophagus, of which it is the sole member. This is likely because the king cobra is larger than other cobras and the stripe on their necks is in the shape of a chevron rather than a double or single eye shape. Their hoods are also narrower and longer. King cobras typically eat other snakes, and occasionally reptiles or rodents.
