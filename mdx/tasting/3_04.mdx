Described once long ago by a great co-host as a drink that feels like a "fruit whispering into your mouth as you drink," White Claw quite possibly could be considered the drink that started it all. For this installment we will be sampling from **Variety Pack #2** (and possibly some more), which features <span style={{color:"yellow"}}>**Lemon**</span>, <span style={{color:"#16a085"}}>**Watermeon**</span>, <span style={{color:"orange"}}>**Tangerine**</span>, and <span style={{color:"#e74c3c"}}>**Passion Fruit**</span> flavors (5% ABV).

As Season Three of this series was kicking off in early 2020, White Claw had already been around for nearly four years. Sales had been tripling year over year since its initial release in 2016, and White Claw held 60% of the category market in 2019.

"Bring a pack of White Claw to a party and the guests will love you," I would excitedly proclaim to my friends, fully embracing my role as a bandwagoner (I put up very little resistance). And while this still may hold true today, White Claw has been in a way a victim of its own success, as many new offerings have since offered some healthy competition. White Claw was not the first hard seltzer by any means, but they were one of the very first to popularize it and really made the category what it is today with the help of viral social media videos and marketing campaigns. Like with so many other greats such as Michael Jackson with the moonwalk and Eddie Van Halen with guitar tapping, we owe much of what we have today to what White Claw was able to accomplish.

But let's also understand how we got here! Perhaps not fully satisfied with how Mike's Hard Lemonade was able to break into the market, founder and chief executive of The Mark Anthony Group (henceforth TMAG) Anthony von Mandl created White Claw in 2016. It actually debuted alongside future Season Three feature Truly Hard Seltzer, but it was the aforementioned social media campaigns that allowed White Claw to gain more popularity. And, in my opinion, the taste. Truly does not taste good. Fast forward seven years and while White Claw does not quite have the same market share as it did once, one thing we do know is this; hard seltzers are here to stay. We can thank White Claw for that. Even beer breweries such as Brooklyn Brewery and Other Half have started producing hard seltzers at mass scale. Perhaps we will sample these at a later date.

To close, here are a few various fun facts about White Claw:
* As mentioned above, White Claw is not the first drink by TMAG that we have sampled in this series! Flashback to Mike's Hard Lemonade (S2E03)
* While it might be somewhat debatable which flavors are canon, the White Claw website lists 12 flavors of "base" White Claw, and 4 each of the "Surge" and "Iced tea" variants
* The catchphrase "Ain't no laws when you're drinking Claws" was coined in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FApbkER3uIY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">video</a> by YouTuber Trevor Wallace
  * Wallace went on to start selling tshirts featuring the phrase, but was issued a cease and desist by White Claw's legal team and had to issure refunds
* White Claw is gluten free!
* Elon Musk is an unofficial spokesperson for White Claw: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtOASncefFE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtOASncefFE</a>
