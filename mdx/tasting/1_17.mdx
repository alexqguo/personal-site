As a continuation of the last wine tasting, we will be having another wine from Charles Shaw Winery, SHAW! SHAW is completely organic yet still quite cheap line of wines with many other interesting aspects surrounding it. We will be having a <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Chardonnay**</span> and <span style={{color:"#c0392b"}}>**Cabernet Sauvignon**</span> (both 12.5% ABV). These wines were also purchased at Trader Joe's in NYC.

You can find some fun facts about this wine below:

* The Charles Shaw Winery is owned by Bronco Wine Company, which is headed byâ€¦ drumrollâ€¦ Fred Franzia! That name may or may not be familiar to you. There is a real person named Charles Shaw who previously owned a winery in California, but they went bankrupt in 1990 and were purchased by Bronco. The original Charles Shaw is still alive to my knowledge
* Fred Franzia is the nephew of none other than the godfather of cheap wine Ernest Gallo! If you are looking for some background information on Ernest Gallo feel free to take a look back and read the writeups of Thunderbird/Night Train and the Gallo Family wines.
* Charles Shawâ€™s original wineryâ€™s bankruptcy correlated with the divorce between he and his wife. It is unclear whether or not there is a true connection between the two events
* In the early 2000s, Charles Shaw started a new winery named Oerther Vineyards. They are located in Michigan and specialize in Riesling
* As with Two Buck Chuck, SHAW bottles also have corks, which may be surprising for such a cheap wine. However, thereâ€™s a **twist** <sup>(heh)</sup>. These corks are **twist-off**! Itâ€™s called the Helix cork, and it creates an airtight, natural barrier which allows for preservation of unopened wine bottles for up to two years (horizontal or vertical storage)!
