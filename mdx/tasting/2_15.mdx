The Ritas are back! But not as family orientated as the last tasting. This summer Anheuser-Busch brings a strong refresh to its famous sparkling margarita line with The BacheloRITAS. RITAS is the first brand in the Anheuser-Busch InBev portfolio to explicitly target women and last year introduced “The Ritas,” legendary women who take a “life’s-a-party attitude in every situation.” Ritas, which markets itself as a margarita in a can, is actually a malt beverage sans tequila (for those unfamiliar with old french sans means without). That’s right, a margarita without the tequila. While many would find a margarita without tequila an insult, the Rita Family firmly believes in their new social movement #NeverApologize. The Ritas took a full page ad in the New York Times to embrace the adjectives “trashy, gross, girly, basic, and sweet” the drinks often received as feedback and turned it into a campaign about women empowerment.

After scouring for this malt beverage in multiple beer and liquor stores I realized that these BachelorRITAS aren’t as classy as I originally thought. Multiple excursions to 7-11, CVS, and Duane Reade down 8th avenue eventually led me to the women I was looking for. This tasting I’m happy to bring six unique variants of Ritas: <span style={{color:"#16a085"}}>**Watermelon**</span>, <span style={{color:"#f39c12"}}>**Mango**</span>, <span style={{color:"#2ecc71"}}>**Lime**</span>, <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Lemonade**</span>, <span style={{color:"#e74c3c"}}>**Strawberry**</span>, and <span style={{color:"#8e44ad"}}>**Grape**</span> (8% ABV).

I apologize if some of these flavors are repeated from last years October tasting. I was told to check the previous writeup to see which flavors to avoid, but if you scroll up to tasting 2.4 you’ll see Mr. Guo state “I am happy to say that we will be having as many of these flavors as I can get my hands on”...

***But what’s a bacheloRITA without her claws?***

That’s right folks, we couldn’t celebrate JT’s last day without busting out the most infamous drink of Summer 2019. White Claws is the law and we have to celebrate with our CLAWS UP to put a bowtie on these past 12 weeks. For the uninitiated, White Claws are **NOT** malt beverages, but in fact spiked seltzers if not THE spiked seltzer of the century. RITAS, along with many other brands, have recently released spiked seltzer of their own in an attempt to ride as much of the wave as they can. If you’re a fan of LaCroix you’ll love how White Claws taste like a fruit whispering into your mouth as drink. This 100 calories per 12 fl oz drink has become a social phenomenon with similar influence and weight as the Juul. If carbonated water isn’t up your style, then good luck making friends because everyone who is anyone is drinking these.
