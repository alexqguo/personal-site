title: "Malt Liquor"
---

Technically speaking, many different drinks are made with malted barley and are "malt beverages." However, what we will be focusing on is malt liquor, which legally is a bit different than a malt beverage depending on what country you're in. Malt liquors specifically utilize corn or sugar during the brewing process to increase the amount of fermentable sugars, resuilting in a higher alcohol percentage. Flavors can be added on top of that to produce drinks such as Four Loko.
