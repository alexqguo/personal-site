First, on the topic of Four Loko... You may be surprised to see that we are trying Four Loko for the third time. Don't fret, this isn't the same old Four Loko that you're used to. As the popularity and craze of spiked seltzers has grown, many brands not necessarily known to be in the seltzer or FMB markets decided to try and jump on the bandwagon. Four Loko is the first one of these which we will be trying in this season, though there are likely more that will surprise you as the season goes on. Specifically, we will be having **Four Loko Hard Seltzer**, their first foray into the market. Black Cherry flavored, this is their only spiked seltzer so far. And there is one distinguishing feature that separates it from the rest. While most spiked seltzers hover around 5% ABV, in typical Four Loko fashion they had to go hard. Really hard. Four Loko Hard Seltzer is a 12% ABV beverage, making it by far the strongest spiked seltzer in the world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABhai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">chūhai</a> can get up to around 12% as well but technically it's not just a seltzer). It's still a fairly new beverage, so there's been little chatter about the taste and overall experience of drinking it. Will Four Loko Hard Seltzer be a glorious return to relevancy, or is it simply a pathetic attempt at inspiring nostalgia and no more than a flash in the pan? You can be your own judge, but let's find out together.

Now, onto the second topic of conversation for the season debut. On this day we bid farewell to Raheed, who is moving on to his next adventure. To commemorate Raheed and his contributions over the past 1 year, 2 months and 11 days, below are some fun facts about him. We wish you all the best in your next role!

* During his time at Amazon, Raheed has made 208 code changes, good for 17,036 lines added and 3,860 lines removed. His commit messages are all reasonable. The majority of his commits are in the ██████████████████████ package
* He has broken into his own house many times
* Raheed attempted to host the last Four Loko tasting event (see above), but failed spectacularly at fulfilling the co-host requirements. Despite being granted Gold-tier sponsorship status, he was subsequently put on sponsorship probation for three weeks
* Due to this mishap, he took home the Most Disappointing Taster award at the conclusion of Season Two
  * "This award goes to someone whose participation, either as a guest or co-host, left a lot to be desired and was generally below the bar"
* █████ and Raheed are best friends
* Raheed once bet me that he could convince leadership to expense a kegerator for our team. He failed and instead purchased (with his own money) a small keg and mini fridge
* Supposedly Raheed is a master at making an egg in a cup
* Raheed started a playlist on Spotify for the ███ team to share and contribute to. Only ████ contributed. The playlist has four songs
* Raheed loves old 2d platformer games. He once beat Megaman 10 without taking damage or losing lives

**NOTE: Four Loko Hard Seltzer contains no caffeine.**
