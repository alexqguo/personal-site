This week we will be having something that should be familiar to anyone who went to a state university or is from the midwest- Olde English 800. This drink has an interesting history starting in the 1940s when it was known as Ruff's Olde English Stout. It was eventually rebranded as Olde English 600 and sold to Bohemian Breweries. It was then renamed to Olde English 800 and sold again to Blitz-Weinhard, which was eventually bought by the Pabst Brewing Company. In 1979, Olde English had become their top brand. The Miller Brewing Company owns the brand today.

The marketing of this beer presents a theme which we should be familiar with by now- targeting low income and minority consumers. Many of the fortified wines that we are familiar with have fallen under scrutiny for similar practices, and Miller's acquisition of Olde English brought forth a less controversial marketing strategy and even the sponsorship of a series of minority business seminars.

The ABV of Olde English 800 varies depending on where in the country you are located, but the one we will be having is 5.9% ABV. Here are some more fun facts about Olde English 800:
