To kick off season two we will be having a college classic, Four Loko, this Friday! Four Loko is a flavored malt beverage produced by Phusion Projects which debuted in 2005 in the United States. We will have four different flavors: <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Peach**</span>, **Black**, <span style={{color:"#e67e22"}}>**Blaze**</span> and <span style={{color:"#e74c3c"}}>**Watermelon**</span> (12-14% ABV).

In the late 2000s, US state attorney generals began investigating companies which sold caffeinated alcoholic beverages on the grounds that they were being inappropriately marketed towards underage consumers and that there were many health risks. Phusion Projects fell under these investigations as Four Loko in particular gained its notoriety in 2010. Colleges and university campuses around the United States were starting to report many cases of alcohol poisoning and hospitalization of students. This led to a wave of retailers pulling the drink from their shelves and eventually the drink being banned in certain states. Under immense pressure from the FDA, Phusion Projects removed the caffeinated ingredients from Four Loko and relaunched in December of 2010.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you are a WDE/SDE, participation in the tasting will only be allowed if you put out at least one code review for an accessibility bug as part of the bug bash!


Here are some more fun facts about Four Loko:

* Phusion Projects was founded by frat bros Cole Mulick, Jaisen Freeman and Jeff Wright after they all graduated from OSU. I'm not sure I would personally get along with these guys, but you have to admire their entrepreneurial spirit. They would buy Thai energy drinks from a nearby Asian market and sell them to other students, claiming that they were "imported from abroad." By 2005 they had produced a prototype "energy beer" which eventually evolved into what we know as Four Loko today
* The very original recipe of Four Loko contained wormwood, the supposed hallucinogenic ingredient in Absinthe
* By changing the recipe of Four Loko, a black market was inadvertently created for the caffeinated version. The caffeinated Four Loko was appearing on Ebay and Craigslist for as much as five times the original price
* There is a recipe out there for a "Faux Loko" which is essentially a malt beer with some Kool-Aid and sugar mixed in. I bring this up because I happen to have some extra Kool-Aid at my desk
* **Four Loko Shots** is another drink in the Four Loko line, and is a hard liquor that comes in 750ml bottles and is 35% ABV

**(NOTE: we will be having the safer, non-caffeinated version of Four Loko)**
