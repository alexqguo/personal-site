**Goodbye bitterness, so long fullness, hello happiness. Country Club Malt Liquor remains the smooth, non-filling and refreshing Malt Liquor it was back in 1951 when it first began.**

This week we will be trying out **Country Club Malt Liquor** (5.86% ABV). To understand the history of this beer we need to understand the history of malt liquor itself, so naturally our story starts in Europe in the 19th century…

Michael Karl Goetz was born in the Alsace region in what is now Germany on January 16, 1833. Having immigrated to the United States in his 20s, he was on his way to California during the gold rush when he found himself in St. Joseph and eventually decided to stay there. After a stint at another brewery, he founded his own in 1859 named M. K. Goetz & Co., now known as the M. K. Goetz Brewing Company. During the prohibition, they obtained a permit to produce and sell non-alcoholic beer. Once the prohibition ended, however, a few problems were introduced to the beer market. Many consumers were expressing that beer lacked its old “kick,” and on top of that WW2 was a catalyst in instantiating rationing throughout the country. The effect from this was two fold; there was not enough metal for bottle caps, nor was there enough malt to make beer.

In the 1930s and 1940s, smaller breweries Grand Valley Brewing Co. and Gluek Brewing discovered new methods to increase the alcohol content in their beers. Grand Valley Brewing used more sugar in the fermentation process and debuted Clix Malt Liquor. Shortly after, Gluek Brewing was able to add a second fermentation process altogether (and thus more alcohol) in their new beer Sparkling Stite (Olde English 600 also debuted around this time). These methods became the basis for how malt liquor is brewed today. Then in 1951, M. K. Goetz Brewing introduced Country Club Malt Liquor as a means to compete with the Grand Valley and Gluek breweries. Country Club targeted the middle class (hence the name) and was advertised as such. It eventually took off, pushing M. K. Goetz’s continued success in the 50s.

In 1961, struggling brewery Pearl Brewing Company, who had recently lost out on a vote to be acquired by Pabst, purchased M. K. Goetz Brewing, allowing them increased production, additional distribution and access to untapped markets. This was the end of Goetz Brewing, but not the end of Country Club, which continued to be produced under its new owner. Pearl was eventually sold to Southdown, General Brewing and finally ended up under Pabst Brewing Company.

Here are some additional fun facts about Goetz Brewing:

* The old Goetz facility no longer exists. The space is currently a parking facility for a Sears distribution center
* Michael Karl Goetz III passed away quite recently, on October 22. He was born and raised in St. Joseph, and you can donate flowers to him <a href="https://meierhoffer-funeral-home-crematory.tributecenterstore.com/?oId=3390831&tag=Standard&mtph=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>
* A few years there was potential for a comeback of the Goetz brewery, however the plans fell through and it didn't happen :( read more <a href="http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/goetz-brewery-won-t-be-making-comeback/article_ca438c3a-f4cd-57c8-934b-7ff1a8825b89.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>
