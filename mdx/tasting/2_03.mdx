Let's close out the hottest months of the year with two classic summer beverages: <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Mike's Hard Lemonade**</span> (5% ABV) and <span style={{color:"#9b59b6"}}>**Mike’s Harder**</span> (8% ABV). However, to understand the present, we must first understand the past, so let’s take a look at how they came to be. Mike’s Hard Lemonade debuted in Canada (Vancouver to be specific) in 1996. Back then the drink was actually vodka-based, but when it was introduced to the US market, it was switched over to a proprietary malt base. I would guess that this is due to US-specific laws making it more difficult to sell beverage alcohol, and that it made more sense for Mike’s as a business to switch to a malt base.

While Mike's is not known for marketing towards low income groups, there are interesting things to be said about their tactics. Supposedly, Mike's was originally targeted towards men who didn't really like the taste of beer, but did not want to be seen drinking anything else. As those strategies have pivoted through the years, Mike's is now targeting 25-29 year old, highly sought after "millenial males" according to recent statements.

Here are some other fun facts about Mike's:

* As far as I can tell, “Mike” is not a real person. Mike’s was founded by Anthony von Mandl who also happens to be the founder and chairman of The Mark Anthony Group (henceforth TMAG), one of America’s most successful private alcoholic beverage companies
* Mike’s was one of many ready-to-drink (RTD) brands owned by TMAG. Among these brands were the likes of Turning Point, Okanagan, Palm Bay and Stanley Park. TMAG sold the entirety of their RTD entities to Labatt in 2015 for $350 million, allowing them to focus on their wine business
* Mike's was part of a new category of drinks called flavored malt beverages which took off in popularity in the mid-90s. Some would even argue that Mike's pioneered and defined this category
* Is it beer? Yes! Well, sort of. Mike’s Hard is made from a proprietary malt base, similar to most typical beers. However at some point in the process, the base is augmented with sugar, fruit (depends on the flavor) and other "natural flavoring" to create the classic taste we all know and acknowledge
* Mike's Hard Lemonade and Mike's Harder are both gluten free! Mike's works with a third party to ensure their products are at or below the standard for gluten removal
