To close out Season Two of our Tasting Series we will be sampling arguably the most infamous and influential malt beverages of all time. A lot of the FMBs (flavored malt beverages) that we tried this season would not exist without Smirnoff Ice first dominating the market and genre. Smirnoff Ice is a citrus flavored malt beverage (4.5%) part of the Smirnoff brand, produced by the British company Diageo. While Smirnoff Ice debuted in 1999, the Smirnoff brand goes back a long way, with its first vodka distillery being founded by Pyotr Smirnov in Moscow in the 1860s. During the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks captured the Smirnov distillery and imprisoned Pyotr's son Vladimir, who had since taken over control of the company. Vladimir escaped and fled to Constantinople, where he reopened the Smirnov distillery and renamed it to Smirnoff. Smirnoff vodka was also featured in the first James Bond film and has appeared in most subsequent films. In the 90s, Smirnoff started experimenting with malt beverages and released Smirnoff Ice (and Smirnoff Black) in the US.

Smirnoff Ice took the country by storm in the late 2000s, and "icing" became a popular drinking game among college students in particular. Icing is where a player hides, often in a far too elaborate way, a bottle of Smirnoff Ice for another person to find. Upon finding it, you must drop to one knee and chug the entire drink. Some have questioned whether Icing was an organic phenomenon or a marketing stunt by Smirnoff. There OBVIOUSLY will be NO SUCH behavior of that kind during this tasting. Obviously.

While Smirnoff Ice is no longer as popular as it once was, Smirnoff has jumped back into the FMB genre with new flavors of Smirnoff Ice and selections such as Smirnoff Ice SMASHED, a stronger variant of the beverage which falls more in line with other FMBs on the market currently, like Mike's Harder and Four Loko. Smirnoff has even released a spiked seltzer to the market recently.

As an aside, in 2005 the New York Times performed a blind taste test of 21 high end vodkas, but included Smirnoff as well as "a definite step down in status, marketing and bottle design." Smirnoff ended up being the hands down favorite of the tasting panel. NYT published an article describing the test, and called it A Humble Old Label Ices Its Rivals.
