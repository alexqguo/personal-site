We‚Äôre back! Well, sort of. Not really actually. For this special edition of the spiked seltzer tasting series will be sample Bud Light Seltzer (5% ABV), and it will be an **opt-in event**! Meaning, if you have the means and willingness to do so, go ahead and buy some Bud Light Seltzer on your own so you can drink it with us over Chime. If not, then no worries!
In the past eight months, the continued explosion in popularity of spiked seltzers, despite a freaking pandemic, has surprised even those with the most intimate of connections to the market. With too many brands and varieties to count at this point, spiked seltzers have enjoyed a continued and sustainable growth trajectory across the US. The influence is so great that it‚Äôs expanding internationally. White Claw has recently started being sold in Australia. But we‚Äôre not here to talk about White Claw...
AB InBev, eager to continue concocting anything that clears the basic minimum requirement of the term ‚Äúalcoholic beverage‚Äù and throw it under the Bud Light label, may have actually found a winner in Bud Light Seltzer. Debuting in January of this year, the seltzer is light with a surprisingly crisp and clean flavor to it. There are two different variety packs and seven different flavors overall.
Aside from Bud Light Seltzer, however, what makes this edition of the tasting series so special is that we are bidding farewell to Sean, who is moving on from the Amazon family to his next big challenge. In lieu of fun facts about Bud Light Seltzer, here are some fun facts about Sean:

* As of Tuesday evening, Sean has made 1,375 code changes, with 617,297 lines added and 165,680 lines removed. Compared to the last time I threw Sean a goodbye party, some simple math tells us that during his time in SSPA, he made 450 code changes, good for 253,832 lines added and 84,501 lines removed
* After he left Audible, but before he joined ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, Sean spent three months on the ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà team, where he primarily made JSP and jQuery updates while also helping the team migrate from the long deprecated ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà web platform over to ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà. This is almost exactly what we were doing at Audible but worse in many ways
* During this time, Sean contributed literally thousands of lines of JSP and jQuery related code. As part of that work, Sean committed this heinous beast in a JSP file:
‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà

  * I didn't even know you could do this!
* Sean is very private and frequently ignores many messages I send him, so I have no further fun facts about him to share at this time

#### Reflection on COVID, and this series as a whole

The past months have been tremendously difficult for many of us. Along with the many changes across the world, we have also dealt with fear, loss and isolation on a personal level. For many of us this occurs on a daily basis. If you‚Äôre reading this, stop and take five seconds right now to acknowledge and congratulate yourself for rolling with the barrage of jabs, hooks and haymakers that is this year and continuing to deliver results at the Amazon quality standard.

We have not had one of these events in nearly eight months! 231 days, to be exact. In the entire three year history of this event, the next longest gap between tastings was 97 days, and other than that occurrence everything else was under two months (the fastest turnaround was six days, which happened twice üòÖ). It was a struggle to figure out how to bring this event back, or if I even should. But Sean departing the Amazon family seemed like the perfect opportunity, and here‚Äôs why!

He probably wouldn‚Äôt ever admit it, Sean could be seen as a co-founder of this entire series. As mentioned briefly in Season 1, Episode 5 (Sean‚Äôs first goodbye tasting), these tasting events started from a bet we made that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to find a bottle of champagne/sparkling wine for under $5. Perusing Newark‚Äôs finest establishments, I came across a peculiar drink called Wild Irish Rose priced at $2.10 for a 375ml bottle. While it was no Andr√©, I purchased a few bottles of it anyway and brought them back to the office for us and Alberto to sample.

With an 18% ABV and a taste that demanded the most of its drinker, Wild Irish Rose was like nothing I had ever had prior, and I just **had** to know more about it, particularly why it existed. The ensuing research led me to discover a category of beverage known as ‚Äúgutter wine‚Äù (or more crudely as ‚Äúbum wine‚Äù). The site <a href="http://bumwine.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">bumwine.com</a> helped Sean and I to learn that there was a world and history of these drinks beyond just Wild Irish Rose, and so we set out to try them all. Luckily enough, there was a liquor store named Extra which stocked them all, and it was just a 15 minute walk from the Audible office! One by one we worked our way through the gutter wines, the flavors and colors of which will never be forgotten. One of them even turns your tongue black! Eventually we ran out of gutter wines, but continued to sample the budget offerings of Extra. As the number of wines we sampled grew, so did the interest in what we were doing. In true Audible fashion, we <a href="https://www.audible.com/about/people-principles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">activated caring</a> as best we could and invited everyone! Even the VP of the web team got in on the action a few times (and tried to start his own version of the series after I left Audible). What started out as a basic bi-weekly delinquency evolved into a regularly hosted series with snacks, jazz, a yule log and a full writeup of the featured beverage, in Audible‚Äôs nicest conference room, even after both Sean and Alberto left the company. If I hadn‚Äôt had so little to do at Audible most of the time I would have really struggled to keep up with the demand of these events, as I had to source the alcohol and snacks, do the research and send a calendar invite with a full writeup. But ultimately that didn‚Äôt matter to me, because people were coming together in ways not typical of a standard workplace and that was fantastic.

It seems fitting that nearly three years to the day of our first ever tasting event we can look back and see how far we‚Äôve come as we bid farewell to a founding father of the tasting series. Things have certainly changed, and while today won‚Äôt have the esotericism of the early events at Sean‚Äôs desk with a bowl of cashews, or the grandeur (and occasional overindulgence) of some of our more recent gatherings, let‚Äôs embrace the weirdness of this virtual happy hour and enjoy it for what it is!

Thank you all for reading! While this event will be on an indefinite hiatus from this point forward, I hope to see you all at some point soon! There are too many spiked seltzer offerings out there waiting to be consumed alongside Lunchables and tacky jazz music to miss- opportunities that surely cannot be passed up.
