We have a very special wine to taste today - <span style={{color:"#27ae60"}}>**Casal Garcia Vinho Verde**</span> all the way from Portugal <sup>(via Rhode Island)</sup>! The Casal Garcia winery has a rich history dating back to 1939, and their Vinho Verde (literally translates to "green wine") is one of their most popular products and has even won some awards from publications such as *The Tasting Panel* and *Wine Enthusiast*. Some more facts about this wine are listed below. Special thanks to Alberto for providing!

* Casal Garcia was founded in 1939 by Roberto Guedes (RIP), and his family still runs the winery today
