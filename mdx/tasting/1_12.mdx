For this weekâ€™s wine tasting we will be having something a bit less obscure, **Anjos de Portugal**. Anjos de Portugal is produced by **Quinta da Lixa**, a family owned and operated winery established 30 years ago. There will be two types, a <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>white</span> (9.5% ABV) and a <span style={{color:"#e74c3c"}}>rosÃ©</span> (10.5% ABV).

The term //Vinho Verde// does not refer to a type of grape, rather it translates literally to Green Wine and falls under the PDO system for the production of wine. Vinho Verde, being a type of wine, falls under DOC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denomina%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_Origem_Controlada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denomina%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_Origem_Controlada</a>) classification, which regulates wines, cheeses and other agricultural products produced in Portugal. DOC is part of the PDO system (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_indications_and_traditional_specialities_in_the_European_Union#Protected_designation_of_origin_(PDO)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Protected designation of origin</a>) in the European Union, and other European countries have similar systems. We have also had a Vinho Verde wine before, in our sixth installment.

Here are some more fun facts about Quinta da Lixa, Anjos de Portugal and Vinho Verde:

* Vinho Verde wine is typically light and fresh, and has small amounts of CO2 in it, not officially qualifying it as a sparkling wine, but enough to still feel slightly bubbly (thereâ€™s a word for this- pÃ©tillance)
* Quinta da Lixa was founded by the Meireles family in 1986
* Originally only selling their wines in bulk, Quinta da Lixa eventually switched over to bottles due to the wine being well received
* Quinta da Lixa actually sponsors a few Portuguese sports teams: UCS (Union Cyclista do Sobrado) and UDV (VÃ¡rzea Sports Union)
* ðŸ’°$3 according to Alberto ðŸ’°
