We will be having two very different and interesting wines this week, **San Nicola**’s garganega <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>pinot grigio</span> and **Vindicum**’s moscato semi sweet <span style={{color:"#e74c3c"}}>rosé</span> called “Sweet Girl” all the way from Moldova! These wines aren’t related to each other in any way, but I thought they might contrast well. Given neither of these wines is made by a particularly esteemed winery, and the rosé doesn’t list any winery at all, the research was a bit more tricky this time.

Here are some interesting facts about these wines and their origins.

* ”First of all, for those who didn’t previously know (like me), the Republic of Moldova is a small landlocked country in eastern Europe, bordered by Romania and Ukraine
* Moldova, known as Bessarabia in the late 1800s, was integrated into Romania during the Russian Revolution in 1917. However in 1940 Romania was forced to relinquish Bessarabia to Russia, and the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was created. When the Soviet Union was dissolved, the Moldavian SSR became independent and renamed itself to Moldova, which is where we stand today
* Believe it or not, Moldova actually has a fairly well established wine industry, and is roughly the 20th largest wine producing country in the world
* Vindicum Wines was established in the late 60s as a part of a national initiative for more wine production in the Moldavian SSR
* Semi dolce is Italian for semi sweet, and San Nicola is Italian for Saint Nicolas
* The San Nicola pinot grigio comes from Italy and is labelled with a PGI for the Veneto region. A PGI (protected geographical indication) is essentially a way of protecting and promoting the names of certain food and beverages. PGI status denotes that the product (often things like wine, cheese and meat) is manufactured within that region, in this case Veneto
* Garganega is a grape variety which is commonly grown in the Veneto region, and is also Italy’s sixth most planted white grape
* I’m having a really hard time finding any information about the San Nicola winery. I did find a San Nicolò winery, and messaged them on Facebook to see if they can point me in the right direction. I will let everyone know if I hear back
* 💰 $3.99 per bottle, both wines 💰
