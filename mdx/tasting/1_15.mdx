This week we have another special going away wine tasting. Ishan will sadly be leaving us, and Friday is his last day. Ishan has been a key member of the Audible web team for the past three years, and we will be sad to see him go. Our wines are <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Dreambird Pinot Noir**</span> and <span style={{color:"#c0392b"}}>**Dreamfish Sauvignon Blanc**</span>. I have had the Dreambird Pinot Grigio and can vouch that it is a great budget wine, but that's besides the point. Instead of facts about the wine, here are some fun facts about Ishan:

* Ishan joined Audible on July 20, 2015 and has amassed 96 â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ since then. Not a very impressive number, but more than some
* As of today (Wednesday, June 27), Ishan has made **551** code changes, good for **28,367** lines added and **9,738** removed
* Ishan will be joining the â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ team in Chennai, after being on the â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ and â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ teams here in Newark
* Other than the bootcamp stuff, Ishanâ€™s first code change was the very technical task of removing a â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ from â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ. Here is the CR: â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ
** I recently found out that this change actually BROKE the â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ for a few hours! Way to go Ishan!!
* Ishan has a proclivity for finding the most obscure yet legitimate bugs, and is a frequent beta tester
* What do Alabama and Ishan have in common? They share a birthday! It is also an unofficial international holiday, Monkey Day!
* Ishan was once hit by a moving fan that fell off the ceiling onto his head
* ðŸ’°$9 each ðŸ’°
