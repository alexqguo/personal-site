We have a special wine tasting this time as it is Sean‚Äôs last week. The wine will be **Cooper and Thief**, and it is NOT a bum wine! There will be no fun facts about the wine this time; I will instead list fun facts about Sean. Let‚Äôs all get together and wish Sean good luck in his next endeavor.

* As of Thursday morning, Sean has made 925 code changes (with 363,465 lines added and 81,179 lines removed) during his time at Audible
* Sean‚Äôs first commit (other than SDE bootcamp) was ‚Äú‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚Äù. It had a few issues which were brought up in the code review
* Sean has been the sole owner of ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà for the past six months. He desperately wanted to change the name of ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà to SeanSkin but was convinced otherwise
* Everyone on Sean‚Äôs interview loop was not inclined, and in fact ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà was strongly not inclined. After the debrief a theory was formed that he drugged all of his interviewers. So far no proof of this exists, and how he got here remains a mystery
* During the recent Code Blitz hackathon, Sean was kicked off the team over 10 times for misconduct and poor ideas
* According to the promotion announcements, the main thing which got Sean promoted was that he was "meticulous in testing his code to ensure that there are almost no bug fix-test iterations.‚Äù Great job testing your code Sean, so proud
* This wine tasting series all started from a bet between Sean and I that a bottle of champagne/sparkling wine could not be found for under $5. For the record I did find one for $4.95
* üí∞Roughly $25 per bottle üí∞
