This week we will be having two wines, a <span style={{color:"#f1c40f"}}>**Chardonnay**</span> (13% ABV) and <span style={{color:"#c0392b"}}>**Merlot**</span> (13.5% ABV) from Purple Moon Winery. There‚Äôs not much information about Purple Moon out there, but from what I can tell it is a label private to Trader Joe‚Äôs, and the winery is actually owned by Delicato Family Vineyards. As you can probably guess, these wines were also purchased at the Trader Joe‚Äôs liquor store near Union Square, which I highly recommend.

Here are some fun facts about the wine:

* An amazing quote I found from a Pinterest article: "The Purple Moon Wine brand fills an important niche for people who want to feel like they are buying something better than Charles Shaw, but they still want to spend less than $5.‚Äù
* According to the bottle, ‚ÄúFolklore says our ancestors used to spend all harvest night waiting for a purple hue to appear around the moon signaling it was time to pick the grapes.‚Äù This can happen due to refraction of moonlight from ice crystals in the upper atmosphere. The shape of the ice crystals results in a focusing of the light into a ring
* As mentioned above, Purple Moon is actually owned by Delicato Family Vineyards whose portfolio includes wines such as Bota Box (a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù boxed wine) and Noble Vines
* Based on the limited information available online, the reviews for this wine are... not very good
* Delicato Family Vineyards was founded in Manteca, California by Gaspare Indelicato, an Italian immigrant. Manteca reminded Gaspare of Sicily, where his family had grown wine grapes in Italy. Like many vineyards, Delicato is a family business, with the current CEO being Chris Indelicato
