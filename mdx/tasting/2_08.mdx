Greetings! We have a great product to sample this week which I have been especially looking forward to. It's **Steel Reserve**, a "high gravity" lager. It was introduced in 1994 and has an 8.1% ABV. Steel Reserve is brewed by Steel Brewing Company, which is owned by ABInBev (formerly SABMiller), one of the world's largest beer conglomerates. They control many of America's beers that we know and love dearly, like Bud Light Lime and Natural Light. Steel Reserve also has a "Triple Export Malt Liquor" or "Black" variety, though I have no idea what that means.

SABMiller owned Steel Reserve until late 2016, when they merged with Anheuser-Busch InBev, in a deal worth more than $100 billion. That puts Steel Reserve under the same umbrella as craft breweries like Elysian and Goose Island. Think about that for a second.

Many things are unique about this beer, but its brewing process warrants particular attention. Steel Reserve uses roughly twice the amount of ingredients (like barley and hops) as typical lagers do, and is brewed for twice as long. This helps to increase the gravity of the beer (more on that below). Steel Reserve also introduced the "high gravity" nomenclature, which Anheuser-Busch eventually adopted as well on their own Hurricane High Gravity Lager, a drink analogous to Steel Reserve in many aspects.

Here are some more fun facts about Steel Reserve:

* What is gravity? What is time? Why are we here in this universe? I can't really answer any of those questions, but I can tell you that gravity as it relates to beer is a measurement used to quantify the fermentable sugars in an alcoholic beverage. It usually gives an indication of the drink's alcohol content
* The "211" mark on the side of Steel Reserve bottles and cans is based on the medieval symbol for steel, seen <a href="https://www.symbols.com/symbol/steel-%28alternate-%231%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>
* Following the market trends, Steel Brewing Company has created their own FMB (flavored malt beverage) named Steel Reserve Alloy Series (which we will likely cover in this series at a later date)
* Both Reverend Horton Heat and The Ramones were commissioned to release some radio jingles for Steel Reserve in the 1990s
* I saw the following comment on an online forum discussion about Steel Reserve, and found it too hilarious to omit from this wiki
  * *This beer turned me into an alcoholic. It is cheap and easy to get. How sorry I am! Many health problems aside from being disgracefully drunk! Have constant rashes on my face and bruises. No, I donâ€™t fall down to get bruised, 211 puts them on my face with no effort from me. I hate to guess what is going on with my liver and heart. and guess what? I can drink hard alcohol and not have the skin rashes and hives and bruises. 211 is nothing but poison! Think about it. Yes, you have a right to drink. But you better think twice about putting straight poison into your body! BTW, have also used meth and not had so many health problems!!! Think about that! I am now in recovery from everything, but hold no judgment against people who want to drink and drug. I still relapse, we are all human and need to feel good. But I will never put 211 poison in my body again!!!!!*
