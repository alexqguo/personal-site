███ has always been about "the big one" — the big campaign, the big JS bundle, the big deployment. Like they say, big stories call for a big daddy, **Natty Daddy**. We will be sampling Natty Daddy this time around, an 8% ABV malt liquor and the strongest beer of the Natural Light line of beverages (others include Natural Ice, Naturdays and of course the infamous Natural Light). But with such a big name, can Natty Daddy's taste live up to the hype? Answer: no.

To be frank, the reputation of this beer is quite horrendous. Maintaining a 2.04/5 average rating on Untappd, this beer has consistently received a multitude of bad reviews no matter where you look since its debut in 2012. They say it's "brewed with the same all-natural ingredients as Natural Light," but if I am not sure if that's a good thing. Natural Light is considered by many to be one of the worst beers available in the country.

Anyway, here are a few more fun facts about Natty Daddy:

* Natty Daddy and the rest of the Natural Light line is, of course, produced by Anheuser-Busch, one of the world's five large beer conglomerates
* A can of Natty Daddy comes with 1.4 grams of protein. Time to get swole!
* My favorite description of this beer comes from Urban Dictionary, where a comment described it as "what you bring to the party for drinks when Four Lokos are considered too sophisticated"
* Natural Light is actually giving away $1 million to pay college loans for students. At least they know their target audience
* Introduced in 1977, Natural Light was Anheuser-Busch's first reduced-calorie light beer, and in 2008 shocked the world by taking the bronze medal (!!) at the World Beer Cup in the American-style light lager category
* In 2011, Natural Light became the first beer to go to space (why?)
* Natural Light actually has a stores page on Amazon: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/3036482011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/3036482011</a>
  * I'm not sure how legit that page is. While you can purchase a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Light-Natty-Daddy-Medium/dp/B07BR1W3SN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Natty Daddy t-shirt</a>, they also have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beeswax-Candle-Burns-Candle-Michigan/dp/B01ABH6RBC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Natural Light beeswax candles</a> and a curious amount of solar attic fans.
