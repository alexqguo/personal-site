* A "serving" is half of a light beer
* Pour a serving of beer into a cup before the round starts. If forgotten, you can pour the drink after a round is over, however the loser **cannot** pour their own drink
* The loser of the previous round goes first. If there were multiple losers, whoever finished their drink fastest gets "advantage" and goes first
* There should be one three per person playing the game. Remove if less than four players, add if more (can use jokers)
* When possible, things must be done in threes
* Feel free to apply house rules as you see fit
* Positive vibes only
* Above all, respect the game

<br/>

## Gameplay
* Players take turns drawing cards from a deck and showing them face up
* If you pull a three, you are safe
* Once all the threes are drawn, anyone without a three chugs a serving of beer
* Before drinking, players **must** say "いただきます", "行きます", "cheers" or something similar
* If the chug is interrupted in some way (lips coming off the cup, stopping to laugh), the cup is immediately topped up and the chug restarted
  * Interruptions on the second chug are irrelevant
* Any foul results in an immediate batsu game. The main game is resumed once the batsu is over
* If a round ends with everyone safe (everyone pulled a three), everyone instead loses and drinks a double serving

<br/>

## Batsu game rules
* Batsu game is played 2v1, where the one is the offender and the two are any two other players
* Get creative and come up with a fun, quick game. Cannot repeat games
  * The offender cannot choose their own batsu game. Decision/approval must come from the others in the group
* If the offender wins, all others chug half a serving
* If the offender loses, they drink double a serving
* No further fouls or chugging interruption penalties can occur during a batsu game

<br/>

## Example batsu games
* Handstand competition
* Furthest throw of a card
* Bouncing a coin into a cup
* Hit a target with a frisbee
* Tug of war (with a towel)
* Fastest to take all their clothes off and put them back on

<br/>

## Example fouls
* Drawing out of order
* Spilling beer
* Laughing or stopping during beer chug
