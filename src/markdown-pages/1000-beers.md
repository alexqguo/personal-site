If you're a frequent beer drinker as I am, you may have heard of a mobile app called <a href="https://untappd.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Untappd</a>. Think of Untappd as a sort of social network for beer drinkers. You can rate beers, post a "check-in" that your friends can comment on, see what local bars are serving and *much* more (seriously, I could write an entire post just about my experience with the app).

One of the app's most basic features is to tell you how many unique beers you have checked in. The other day I checked in my 1,000th unique beer since creating my Untappd account nearly exactly four years ago. The beer was a Freaky Hijiki by Interboro Spirits & Ales. Not a particularly notable beverage, however I can be a sucker for milestones and so it got me in a contemplative mood. I found myself wondering, "Out of these 1,000 beers, which have been the most notable?"

So I set out to come up with a list. Not just of beers that were really good or bad, however. While a simple top ten would be fine, I wanted to incorporate beers that remind me of something I find meaningful into my list, as they were quite often social vessels as well and part of a larger story. I also wanted to be able to purchase and drink each one of these beers again, so they're going to be restricted to what I can find within the general vicinity of my apartment in Brooklyn during a global pandemic (yes, this narrows the pool quite a bit). 

With that, here is my list of my most notable, locally sourceable beers from my Untappd profile.

## First Love
**Three Philosophers** (Ommegang)  
Probably the first beer I ever truly *loved*, Three Philosophers is a Belgian style quadruple ale made by the good people at Ommegang. With a 9.7% ABV, if you can get your hands on one of the 750ml bottles, just the one will likely be enough to get you to a good place. After two, you could end up watching the news on your couch at 11pm yelling nonsense like, "It won't be that cold!" to your local weatherman. This is just a hypothesis and is in no way based on real life experiences. The bourbon barrel-aged special edition is even better (and stronger!), if you can get your hands on it. 

## Go-to Quarantine Beer(s)
**What Might Have Been** (Threes)  
**All Mosaic Everything** (Other Half)  
Without the ability to go to breweries myself right now, I've gotten into the habit of bringing the brewery to me. Many local breweries have expanded greatly on their delivery services, to the delight of those of us who have been isolating themselves at home for the majority of this year. Two breweries local to me in Brooklyn, Threes and Other Half, have been a large part of my supply these days. While I have sampled a great deal of both of their catalogs, What Might Have Been and All Mosaic Everything have stood out to me. Two very different beers, the first being a lighter lager while the latter is a hard and heavy, sometimes even overbearing, double IPA. Nevertheless, for as grim as this year has been I have found solace and comfort in both of them. 

## My 100th
**Saison** (Allagash)  
I was introduced to Untappd back in October of 2016 by a close friend of mine who had been using the app for a few months. She showed me some of its features and within minutes I found myself installing it on my phone as well. With us both being hyper-competitive people, it didn't take long for a contest to develop. The first one to check in 100 unique beers on the Untappd would win perennial bragging rights, and nothing else if memory serves.

Knowing I had some ground to make up, I became immediately obsessed with the competition, telling all of my friends about it and referencing my Untappd profile any time I want to any bar, ever, to make sure I was *only* drinking beers I had not yet recorded. After roughly two months had passed, a Friday evening found me with 94 unique beers and my friend with 97. I knew that if I waited until Saturday evening I would likely lose. So I did what any reasonable person would do, which was to go to Trader Joe's as soon as I woke up, buy a build-your-own six pack with only new beers, and drink it as soon as I got home to get to exactly 100 unique beers. I started drinking around 10 in the morning, finishing up in the early afternoon. Once done, I took a nap and enjoyed my 4pm hangover. 

It was an unhealthy obsession as much as it was worth it to win. Sometimes in life you just need a W, no matter how silly it may seem. 

## Most Fun Beer Series
**Baltika**  
One fall evening in college, my roommates and I were on a typical beer run to our local liquor store (long live Johnny's!). One of my roommates found a peculiar looking, large brown plastic bottle labeled "Baltika #9" priced at roughly $3 with an 8% ABV. This was an obvious purchase, though we were curious what the significance of the 9 was. Without getting into the details, all I can say is that there was a urination incident that evening. While we never had Baltika again for the rest of college, it had left a strong impression.

So years later, when I saw not just Baltika #9, but #2 through #8 as well (#1 is no longer in production) in my local supermarket, I knew what I had to do. I said "Fuck it, groceries can wait" and bought as much Baltika as I could carry to take home. It's still not clear to me why they're numbered instead of given proper names, but I find it rather peculiar and fun. The series ranges from lagers to porters to pilsners and even a hefeweizen. Honestly they're all pretty mediocre, but I did enjoy Baltika #5.

## Worst Beer
**Zhigulevskoe (Жигулевское)** (Baltika)  
For as much as Baltika was able to produce an intriguing series of beers, they also produced one of the greatest stinkers I've ever had. This beer was sold alongside Baltika's numbered beers at my supermarket, and only came in a 40oz variety. In my excitement, I bought two of them. The results were... not what I was hoping for. As my Untappd check-in can attest, it tasted like a homeless person's bed pan. I remember it not feeling carbonated enough. So who knows, maybe I bought a bad one. I still have the other 40, though two years later I'm not expecting a much different outcome.

## ~~Best~~ Worst Non-Beer
**Hard Seltzer** (Four Loko)  
You can find things like ciders, meads and seltzers on Untappd. So my initial thought for this was, why not pick one of the best non-beers I've had to write about. However when looking through what I have checked in, nothing really stood out. So I pivoted, and decided to write about one of the *worst* non-beers I've had. While Truly is unquestionably bad, that should be a universal truth at this point. My choice for this category was Four Loko because, well, who in their right mind makes a 12% ABV hard seltzer?! Four Loko's hard seltzer is the antithesis of what a hard seltzer should be. It's heavy, overly sweet and makes for a cumbersome drinking experience. And will fuck your shit up promptly. 

To fully illustrate why I had purchased five cans of Four Loko Hard Seltzer for an office event requires a much longer explanation, but in summary, I blacked out while still in the office and apparently ended up revealing an extremely embarassing story about myself related to a botched squatty-potty experience. Despite the aforementioned fucking up of my shit, I eventually came to in a chicken restaurant in KTown where I was able to slowly regain hold of my consciousness. Another restaurant and two hours of karaoke later, the night finally concluded and has been fondly remembered by all ever since.

## Not *Actually* That Bad
**Bud Light Platinum** (AB InBev)  
My hottest take of this post. I'm already bracing myself for the pitchforks. But hear me out. Platinum is a 6% ABV lager that comes in at the Bud Light price point. In NYC, it costs roughly $11 for a six pack. In our terms, that's CHEAP. It's more substantial than your typical American light ale, and not nearly as heavy or disgusting as "Ice" beers. It's even kind of smooth. Honestly, and I'm taking a deep breath as I write this, I think this beer is comparable to Stella. Maybe I'll do a direct comparison between the two at some point. Just give it a chance before you decide to hate me!

## Most WTF
**Bud Light Chelada Clamato Mango** (AB InBev)  
Okay, yes, this one is also not really a beer. But as I've mentioned above, you may be surprised at what you can find on Untappd. Anyways, depending on your perspective there are a few levels of eccentricity happening here. The first is [clamato](https://www.clamato.com/en), a hybrid of tomato juice and clam broth. Then, because of course they did, Bud Light threw their logo on it and started selling the Bud Light [Chelada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelada) with Clamato. And then on top of that added a mango flavored variant as well.

I actually tried this with my mom, who surprisingly was willing to indulge me in sampling something which was most likely going to be horrible. It tasted... exactly how you would expect a mix of those ingredients to taste. Which is to say, not great. I'll be sticking to more typical micheladas in the future.

## I'll Never Look At This Beer the Same
**Golden Monkey** (Victory)  
I used to adore Golden Monkey. I suppose I still do. But I will never be able to look at it again without being reminded of one fateful night in Atlanta years ago. I was visiting some friends for a long weekend, and flew in Thursday night. Coming straight from work, I hadn't had a chance to eat anything since lunch. I was starving upon arriving, but it was rather late so my friend suggested we go to a bar for a quick bite while catching up over some beers. While I *think* we had beer other than Golden Monkey, that's the only one I can remember having. Eventually the monkeys started flowing as did the conversation and somehow inexplicably, I forgot about dinner. 

Across the bar was some random stranger trying to convince us to buy this disgusting sounding mixed drink. While we refused, he eventually purchased one for us anyway. The drink was basically a long island iced tea, with Kahlua instead of coke, and you have to chug it with a straw. As far as my memory is concenred, the night ended there. I woke up the next morning with trace amounts of vomit on my clothes, but oddly enough, no sign of vomit anywhere in or around the house. I looked around to be sure I hadn't dropped my innards in an inconspicuous location, but nothing. A mystery to this day. Needless to say, that was one of the worst hangovers of my life and I accomplished approximately zero work that day. All because of those damn monkeys!
